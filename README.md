# bfh-chatbot-lti
LTI endpoint for BFH Reflective mentor chatbot

NOTE - inside the app folder there are two rsa key files.
It is recommended that on a production environment, these files are regenerated by
running keygen.js

You will need to make sure that the chatbot tool (bfh-chatbot-bot) has a copy of the rs256.rsa.pub file in its root.
